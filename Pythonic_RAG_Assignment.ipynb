Requirements and Goals of the System  \\nüí°      You should always clarify requirements at the beginning of the interview. \\nBe sure  to ask questions to find the exact scope of the system that the interviewer \\nhas in mind.  \\nOur URL shortening system should meet the following requirements:  \\n \\nFunctional Requirements:  \\n1.

Between Application Servers and database servers  \\n3. Between Application Servers and Cache servers  \\n\\nInitially, we could use a simple Round Robin approach that distributes incoming \\nrequests equally among backend servers. This LB is simple to implement and does \\nnot introduce any overhead. Another benefit of thi s approach is that if a server is \\ndead, LB will take it out of the rotation and will stop sending any traffic to it.  \\nA problem with Round Robin LB is that we don‚Äôt take the server load into \\nconsideration. If a server is overloaded or slow, the LB will not stop sending new \\nrequests to that server. To handle this, a more intelligent LB solution can be placed \\nthat periodically queries the backend server about its load and adjusts traffic based \\non that.  \\n10.
